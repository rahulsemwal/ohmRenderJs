# ohmRenderJs
It is an open source "Javascript Template Engine Library" based upon fast HTML rendering and providing small hack for making HTML web pages faster as same as Handlebars, Angular, React, vue js, etc..  

# Idea
what are we doing here that creating a compiler bot who can manage and convert raw input into something human understandable things. In basic words a javaScript library which allows to create self powered js component for web pages and each componets must follow the rule of "Cohesion" and "Coupling" with other components.

# Way of going
  - Understand all about DOM with noscript disable
  - Understand All about DOM with noscript enabled
  - Understand Window.document
  - Understand new DOM concept of web from W3c, so that we can code with updated concept of DOM and browsers.
  - Find a best pattern and ideation to create a flexible javascript library
  - First Goal: Implement vanilla javascript for JavaScript lovers which include data binding, event handling, minification and security. 
  - Second Goal: Think to extend towards modern way to build a progressive library 
  - Third Goal: Think to extend a modern Javascript towards a framework which include CSR+SSR, PWA, SEO, Routing, etc

# Extra ordinary
  - Try to think to provide extention for webassembly, Tensorflow.js, AI, VR, AR etc..     
# TASK
* Introduce omify.regiter() for registering object or function available for ohmRender to access
